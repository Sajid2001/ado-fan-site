## Q & A

### Why do the songs take a long time to load?

When the website is not used by anyone, the backend server shuts down until someone uses it again. It takes a while for the server to boot up again, but after it is up and running the songs load much faster. 

### What was the inspiration for this website?

I first learned about Ado through the One Piece Film Red Movie and I found her songs amazing. My personal favorite song is titled 'Odo', which really showcases Ado's ability to switch up voices and adapt to several different genres in the span of three and a half minutes. I highly recommend checking her out, she is an amazing artist. Some of my personal favorite songs are on the website.
